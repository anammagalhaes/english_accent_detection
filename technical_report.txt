TECHNICAL REPORT - ACCENT DETECTION

Date: June 22, 2025
Project: English Speech Accent Detection App

---

## OVERVIEW

This project aims to identify the **accent** of a person speaking English in a video file.
It utilizes a pretrained model from Hugging Face (`HamzaSidhu786/speech-accent-detection`) and exposes it via a **Gradio interface**. The model performs classification over short audio clips.

---

## TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS

- **Gradio** was selected for the front-end due to its simple deployment and user-friendly interface.
- **Hugging Face Spaces** will be used for hosting, which makes the app accessible to anyone through a public URL.
- FFmpeg is used to extract audio from video files before inference.
- The backend is Python-based and no longer depends on FastAPI or Docker for deployment.

---

## FUNCTIONALITY

The app provides three input methods for user flexibility:

1. **Video URL (e.g., direct .mp4 on GitHub):**
   - The backend downloads and processes the video.

2. **Local Path (for internal dev/test only):**
   - The path to a local video file on disk.

3. **Upload File (preferred for end users):**
   - Users can upload a file through the Gradio UI.

Each option triggers:
- Audio extraction (first 40s or a specified window)
- Accent classification using the model

---

## LIMITATIONS

- The model may predict general results like "English" or incorrect classes due to **dataset imbalance**.
- Accents like "Canadian" or "Scottish" may appear as top predictions for unrelated accents.
- FFmpeg is required to extract audio and must be available on the system or included in the Hugging Face Space image.
- Gradio limits local path access for security — that option is best for local development.

---

## FUTURE WORK / BACKLOG

- Replace or fine-tune the model using more balanced, labeled datasets (like Common Voice or custom English corpora).
- Evaluate alternatives such as **Wav2Vec 2.0**, **Whisper**, or **HuBERT** for better performance.
- Add transcript analysis as fallback using Whisper for language cues.
- Add logging & analytics to track usage and model confidence over time.
- Add region-specific visualization on prediction map.

## HARDWARE CONSTRAINTS

Due to lack of GPU resources, model selection was limited to CPU-optimized pipelines. More advanced models were considered but not feasible without cloud compute or hardware acceleration.
