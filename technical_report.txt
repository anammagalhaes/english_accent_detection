Accent Detection API - Technical Report

Overview:
---------
This project provides an API to detect the accent of spoken English in video files using the 'HamzaSidhu786/speech-accent-detection' model from Hugging Face. The service extracts audio, runs inference, and returns the most likely accent.

Why it's valid:
---------------
Although the model occasionally outputs "Canadian" or "Scottish" inappropriately, this behavior is a known issue due to imbalanced training data. The model still generalizes well for broader distinctions such as "American" vs. "British".

Endpoints:
----------
- /upload-audio: Accepts video file uploads (most stable method).
- /detect-accent-url: Accepts URLs to raw video files (e.g., GitHub).
- /detect-accent-local: Accepts absolute local file path (use only in development).

Known Issues:
-------------
- YouTube download was removed due to rate-limiting and scraping errors (403 Forbidden).
- Accent classification is limited by the pre-trained modelâ€™s dataset bias.
- Requires FFmpeg installed and accessible via PATH or environment variable.

Hardware Limitations:
---------------------
The model runs entirely on CPU. More powerful GPU-based models such as Wav2Vec2 or Whisper were not used due to hardware constraints.

Backlog:
--------
- Implement GPU-based model alternatives.
- Add speaker diarization and segment-based accent analysis.
- Improve error feedback for malformed or unsupported input.
- Add support for real-time streaming audio analysis.
